title: "Summarize MoveIt Task Constructor build process"
date: 2020-03-28
---

This it the order in which MoveIt Task Constructor was build. It was started back in Feb 27, 2017. More detailed information about MTC could be found in [ICRA 2019 publication](https://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/download/2918864/2933599/paper.pdf). Since then have been huge enhancement in it. Here, I would try to summarize(while porting some of them to ros2) steps that were involved in creating MTC. Here for simplicity and clarity I would be excluding many details e.g. indicating only the point when any main file or node was included first time and ignoring bug fixes, merge commits to keep it short. Lets roll in:    

- [x] Creating a rough layout of task and subtask class.
- [x] Added first subtask i.e subtask::CurrentState
- [x] As the gripper required a MoveGroupInterface class, I then ported the move_group package.
- [x] Later ported move_group_inferface package and solved non-matching function errors(#179) by making appropriate modifications.
- [x] Added gripper subtask and their relevant function like compute etc.
- [x] Created draft of subtask::GenerateGraspPose
- [x] Improved GenerateGraspPose subtask by adding time management, multiple IK solutions, check collisions, angle delta and grasp offset.
- [x] Then ported planning_scene_interface to add objects in the planning scene.
- [x] Creating a test_gen_grasp_pose and tested the working of subtask::GenerateGraspPose class.
- [x] Added first implementation of cartesian_position_motion
- [x] Improved gripper subtask by allowing collisions with grasped objects
- [x] Then tried improving cartesian_position_motion by adding beginning and end inference but later encountered an issue(#180).
- [ ] Now I started porting cartesian_interpolator.h
