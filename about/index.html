	<h2>How did I develop an interest in Robotics?</h2>
	<font size="2.5"><p>In my childhood, I used to play with many RC toys. Many a time also opened them with curiousity to see what's inside. That is when I started developing my interest in robots unknowingly.
	During my time at IIT Palakkad I participated in various regional and national level competions and headed many projects.
	I also headed the robotic club here and mentored many student project.
	This involvement in various projects and proper guidance of professors(Specially Prof. Santa Mohan Kumar, M.E, IIT Palakkad and Chandra Shekar, CSE IIT Palakkad) further helped me to grow my passionate interest in the field of robotics.</p>
