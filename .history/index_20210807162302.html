		<br/>,I was Born in 1994, bachelor degree, major in finance, graduated in 2017, and did finance and audit work for 4 years after graduation.

In August 2018, I had the idea of changing careers. During the period, I watched video courses such as C language, Java, computer network, etc. , But in the end did not insist on learning.

It was not until August 2019 that I decided to take the front-end as my career development direction. From then on, I started my self-study career while going to work for one and a half years.

<!-- 		I'm passionate about vision-based robotics. -->
		On February 23, 2021, I resigned from the financial position and switched to another job, and finally found a front-end job. From March 16 to April 30, 2021, I resigned for some reason. This is my first front-end job. , It lasts 45 days.

I am currently studying at home. I am ready to do more projects and consolidate the knowledge points I have learned before, and prepare for the next interview and job hunting. :)

I've participated in several robotics and ML related competitions. I was the former head of Robotics Club, IIT Palakkad. My major projects are based on the swarm, slam and vision-based pick and place. I am currently working on mobile manipulators based on ROS. My goal is to lead a robotics research lab and learn more about the field along the way. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p> -->
